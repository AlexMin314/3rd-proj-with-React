# Tea Time

### Key Features

### Rules we adhered to for coding, testing and Github in this group project
1. Creating individual branches for each team member as well as a test branch for testing before merging with master.
2. Pull requests are mandatory when merging.
3. Whenever a function, variable is defined or when a this.setState is called, descriptive comments have to be written.
4. There is one person assigned as the integrator who will perform the merging of branches to the master
5. Trello board is created and tasks are very detailed and with deadlines and color-coding.
6. We have a slack group that keeps track of Github and Trello board changes and updates everyone, we also make use of the Post function in slack to have a shared document.
